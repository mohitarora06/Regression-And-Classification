# Regression-And-Classification
Various regression and classification techniques implemented 

Linear Discriminative Analysis and Quadratic Discriminative Analysis:- These are generative classifiers which are used
to separate out given data into different classes. LDA tries to maximize the distance between the discriminating classes
using linear method whereas QDA get a curve differentiating various classes. This happens due to different covariances
taken for different methods. In LDA, covariance is fixed for each class whereas it is different for different classes in
QDA. Accuracies acheived are 97% for LDA and 96% for QDA.
